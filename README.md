Hi there!

My name is Xaver, I am an active duty US Marine and a front-end developer. I am excited to work on any project and am always striving to continue learning and improving my skills.

As a Marine, I am disciplined, reliable, and dedicated to completing tasks to the best of my ability. These qualities translate well to the world of software development, where attention to detail and the ability to work as part of a team are crucial.

I am experienced in a variety of front-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and contribute to the success of a project.

I am eager to join a team and contribute my skills and experience to help create innovative and high-quality software solutions.
